        <dl class="faq">
            <dt>What is Hello! Party?</dt>
            <dd>Hello! Party is an event held by the creators of <a href="http://hello-base.com/">Hello! Base</a> to celebrate a Hello! Project group coming to the US. At the event there are games, dancing, performances, and general fun for all kinds of fans of Hello! Project. Watch our IndieGoGo video for some footage!</dd>
            <dt>When is it going to be held?</dt>
            <dd>With any luck, Hello! Party 4 will be held on the evening of October 4th (Saturday). However, planning is still underway so this could still change. Check back for official announcements on the time and date!</dd>
            <dt>Where is it going be held?</dt>
            <dd>Plans are still being worked out, but we are looking to stay as close to the Best Buy Theater as possible to make sure transportation will be easy for everyone.</dd>
            <dt>Does it cost anything?</dt>
            <dd>Since New York City prices higher than locations we've been to in the past, there will be a cover charge this time. We still tried to keep costs low, though, so you can get your entrance for only $10 by pledging to our <a href="http://igg.me/at/helloparty4">IndieGoGo campaign</a> or pay slightly more (won't be more than $20) at the door.</dd>
            <dt>What is IndieGogo?</dt>
            <dd>IndieGogo is a popular crowd-funding site, similar to Kickstarter. Basically, it is a way to raise funds for the thing that you want to do â€“ like a bake sale, only with better rewards than a cupcake.</dd>
