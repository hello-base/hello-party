        <h2>The Party</h2>
        <p><strong>The primere event for Hello! Project fans.</strong> Brought to you by the couple behind <a href="http://hello-base.com/">Hello! Base</a>, Hello! Party was created as a way to celebrate when a Hello! Project group comes to the US. The events have had a little bit of everything from dancing to performances to karaoke, but the main focus are the audience-participation games (inspired by those that Hello! Project groups have played themselves).</p>
        <p><strong>Follow the event on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23helloparty4">Twitter (#helloparty4)</a> and on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1474030566186882/">Facebook</a>!</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Let's make a gift for Morning Musume｡’14</strong></p>
        <p>Idols often have "cheki" (Japanese polaroid) events where you take a photo with the idol and take it home as a memento. Well, we're turning the tables – this time, the photos will be a memento for the members. We'll have a cheki station at Hello! Party 4 where you can take your photo, decorate it, and add it to a scrapbook that wil be gifted to the members on Sunday, after the concert. Adding your photo is free, though you can purchase additional photos for only $5.</p>

            <h3>Where is it going be held?</h3>

            <h3>What time should I plan to be there by?</h3>
            <p>You should aim to be there by 6:30pm (EST) if you can. The event begins at 7pm, but you still have to check in, find your seat, and there will be a photo station as well. You can come late, but you'll miss out on some of the fun!</p>

            <h3>How do I get there?</h3>

          <li class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is it free?</h3>
            <p>The higher cost of venues in New York City unfortunately made free entry impossible this time around. However we did our best to keep the cost of entrance low: through September 7th you can purchase entrance for only $10 via <a href="http://igg.me/at/helloparty4">IndieGogo</a> (this is our fundraising campaign – other perks such as T-shirts or guaranteed game participation also available there). Between September 8th and October 1st, you can purchase entrance for $15 through EventBrite. Lastly, on October 4th (the day of the event) the at-the-door price will be $20.</p>

            <h3>Can merchandise or perks be purchased at the event?</h3>
            <p>Hello! Party 4 T-shirts and other perks were exclusively available through our fundraising campaign on <a href="http://igg.me/at/helloparty4">IndieGogo</a>. You will not be able to purchase them at the venue, but there's still time – we'll be taking orders until the campaign ends on September 7th. <a href="http://igg.me/at/helloparty4">Get them while you still can</a>.</p>

          <li class="faq-item">
            <h3>Will there be food and drinks at the event?</h3>
            <p>There will be no food, and the only drinks available at the event will be water. We strongly recommend you eat before coming, or bring something to much on. Please don't bring alcohol though, as the venue does not allow it without a permit.</p>
